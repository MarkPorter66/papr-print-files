# Contour Sourcing
-----------------

These contours were derived using NIOSH headforms, referenced below.  Once the headform had been loaded into Fusion 360, the following procedure was used to create the contours:

Beginning with the NIOSH large 3D headform, the initial design was created on a 2D plane using a B-spline for the inner profile, relative to the headform not using any explicit geometric relations. The spline positioning and shape was adjusted to mimic the coverage of existing FFRs. A copy of the profile was then projected 4 mm radially outward in the same plane to create the outer profile. These two B-splines were joined with vertical lines at either end to create a closed contour. The contour was projected from the 2D plane onto the 3D surface of the Large NIOSH Headform from the Principal Component Analysis Study, forming the face contact surface. The surface was then mirrored about the center plane.
